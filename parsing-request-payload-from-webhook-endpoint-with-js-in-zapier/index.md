## Introduction
- Hi guys,....


## The problem
- Zapier integration, doesnt really parse the data sent to awebhook endpoint in a format that is really usable
- Custom code helps in transforming, manipulating and even cleaing POSTed data from a webhook endpoint


## How?
- After creating zaps, and adding the webhook step
- C by Zapier, it prompts language selection after which there is a textarea that acccepst the appropriate codeblocks
- It is already wrapped in an async block, so await works out of the blue
- Sample: JSON.sfy()


## Conclusion
